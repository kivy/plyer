Plyer
=====

Plyer is a platform-independent api to use features commonly found on various
platforms, notably mobile ones, in Python.

How
---

Plyer tries not to reinvent the wheel, and will call for external libraries to
implement the api in the easiest way, depending on the current platform.

- on python-for-android, pyjnius is used
- on kivy-ios, pyobjus is used
- on windows/mac/linux, commonly found libraries and programs will be used
