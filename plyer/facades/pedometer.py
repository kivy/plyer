class Pedometer(object):
    '''Pedometer facade.
    Pedometer returns the number of steps taken by
    the user since the last reboot while activated.
    If you want to continuously track the number of steps over a
    long period of time, do NOT unregister for this sensor,
    so that it keeps counting steps in the background even when
    the AP is in suspend mode and report the aggregate count
    when the AP is awake.
    With method `enable` you can turn on Pedometer and 'disable'
    method stops the sensor.
    Use property `count` to get Pedometer value.
