'''
Native filechooser dialog facade.
=================================

open_file, save_file and choose_dir accept a number of arguments
listed below. They return either a list of paths (normally
absolute), or None if no file was selected or the operation was
canceled and no result is available.

Arguments:
    * **path** *(string or None)*: a path that will be selected
        by default, or None
    * **multiple** *(bool)*: True if you want the dialog to
        allow multiple file selection. (Note: Windows doesn't
        support multiple directory selection)
    * **filters** *(iterable)*: either a list of wildcard patterns
        or of sequences that contain the name of the filter and any
        number of wildcards that will be grouped under that name
        (e.g. [["Music", "*mp3", "*ogg", "*aac"], "*jpg", "*py"])
    * **preview** *(bool)*: True if you want the file chooser to
        show a preview of the selected file, if supported by the
        back-end.
    * **title** *(string or None)*: The title of the file chooser
        window, or None for the default title.
    * **icon** *(string or None)*: Path to the icon of the file
        chooser window (where supported), or None for the back-end's
        default.
    * **show_hidden** *(bool)*: Force showing hidden files (currently
        supported only on Windows)
    * **on_selection** *(func)*: Callback for fetching the selection.

Important: these methods will return only after user interaction.
Use threads or you will stop the mainloop if your app has one.

.. versionchanged:: 1.4.0
